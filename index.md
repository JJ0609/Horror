        <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>On October 1st of 2024 I gave myself a challenge, this challenge was to watch at least one horror movie everyday and sometimes even more. It was originally just a challenge in celebration of Halloween, but now months later this challenge is still going strong. To date I have watched over 200 movies, and a great deal of them have been older movies. During my search for movies I unfortunately found that many of these movies have little to no information about them, and many did not even have accurate synopses if any at all. So with this webpage I just want to share what I have seen and provide any production information and at least a breif synopsis of each film in hopes that it will help others easily find the information that I myself struggled to find.</p>
